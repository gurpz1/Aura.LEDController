# AuraSharp

A little library knocked up to help programmatically interact with teh ARGB Controler on Asus motherboards

## Preface
Most of the research done to make this happen is not mine. Alot of the hard work had already been done by the [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB) team.
    
All I have done so far is ported  [Addressable Header Controller](https://gitlab.com/cneil02/aura-addressable-header-controller) to dotnet core for my own benefit.

Addressability so far seems to be working on my Asus Prime X590-P.
